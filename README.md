# Edge-detection-using-laplacian-operator
you can compile and execute the program by using Makefile
below are some details:

> to compile all versions (sequential, OpenMP, MPI):
	by:	 		make

> to execute:
	-Sequential by: 	make seq
	-OpenMP by: 		make omp
	-OpenMPI by: 		make openmpi
	-MPI by: 		make mpi

> to clean the results:
	by: 			make clean

> Notes:
General: -all programs using libpng
	 -the programs doing 10 iterations for each to check the best results
	 -in case you need to change iteration number you can go to header.h and change the value of ITERATION_NUMBER to whatever you want
	 -to change input file you need to go to Makefile for sequential, openmp, and mpi to:
		* the line 7 for sequential version and change the name of the desired input image
		* line 10 for OpenMP version
		* line 16 for mpi version
	 - where to change input file in OpenMPI you need to open mpi.job and change input image to the desired one in the line 12
	
OpenMP:
	-to change threads number go the the file omp.c and change the variable THREAD_NUMBER

OpenMPI:
	-to change number of nodes by accessing mpi.job and change:	#SBATCH --nodes=<#No of desired nodes>
	-to change thread number by accessing mpi.job and change:	#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=<desired thread #No>
mpi:
	-to change number of nodes open Makefile in the line 9 you can redefine number of nodes
